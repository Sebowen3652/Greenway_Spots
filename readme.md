The lecture that we had prior to this due date was extremely helpful. When referencing the template I was able to pick apart why we did each thing,
and how it could be altered. During this activity I really wanted to color code each of my marker points based on what sort of activity it was.
I tried many different strategies but was unable to figure it out. Additionally, I tried to mimic the "style:" command to change the color and size
of my markers, but I was unable to figure it out. The final thing I wanted to add to the map is a description of each marker. I was able to either
have the name, or the description. I was not able to get both. If I were to develop this map some more I would learn how to make divisions
within the popups and add a description, as well as a picture of the location. All of that being said, I believe that my map is useful and user
friendly. I look foward to making more web maps in the future.
